A side project I made back in 2016 using the javascript library p5.js. The game is played in a browser and is designed after the game "Bouncedown" where a player must move down onto platforms and avoid either being pulled up too high or falling down too low in order to avoid a game over. Score is accumulated based on how long the player survives.
